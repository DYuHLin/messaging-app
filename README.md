# messaging-app
This was a very exciting project to make. My first attempt at an actual chat application, this was a project that I wanted to make for a long time. It was quite difficult at times. I had so much trouble implementing socket.io for the real time fetching of the messages, took me several days to figure that out. A lot of the project was made using REST API. I used axios again on the frontend and I also used JWT tokens as well. Another thing that was a challenge for me was uploading images to the MongoDB database, with images I uploaded them by converting images to base64 which I felt was the best approach. I implemented several features in this project, such as sending messages, images and links, I also implemented an emoji keyboard, the ability to create group chats and change your details and profile picture.
